            </h2>
            <p class="lead">    A system that helps developers share and edit files in an organized way. By using a versioning control system a group of developers can edit the same file without interfering with each others progress. People can work and edit on the same file at the same time without overwriting each others changes. It also stores information and keeps track of things like the date that the file has been edited and what changes have been made. This is important because files are usually worked on by a team of developers. If they were to always get in each others ways, nothing would ever get done. So, a VCS helps with teamwork. It is also a good organizational tool. The VCS that we use in this class is Github.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">    Github is the versioning control system that we use in this class. It is a distributed versioning control system so all users have a local version of the data. Git makes sure that no files are overwritten unintentionally. This is an interesting subject because we should obviously know about the systems we are going to use in this class. Understanding the programs and systems we use is essential to properly using them. The relevance of this topic is pretty self explainatory. Sharing our files to our peers and proffesors is something that needs to be done in this class. Git helps accomplish that goal.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commmands are used to run git. They allow the user to control what they want. To create a repository you use the command git init. This is the frist step in creating a repository. Using the command "cd" you can create a directory to store your files. "Git add" adds files to the repository so they can be changed and edited. The final basic command we learned about is git commit. This command records the changes that have been made to the file. Knowing these git commands is obviously important to actually control git. If you don't know these then you cannot use git. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Collaboration</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> I think that a big main idea this lesson is collaboration. That is the whole point we use a Versioning control system. Other than the ability to log your changes, but that is also important for collaboration. Collaboration is important and without the use of a VCS it can be hard to collaborate on a project with multiple developers. Things can get confusing, you might overwrite someone elses work, or even not realize that something has been changed. Collaboration is an interesting topic because it isn't just useful in this class, but useful in so many things in life. It is still important thing to learn about in this class. In our future working environments, collaboration will be utilized so it is important to know how to do so.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">    This is one of the most important features of git. It allows you to document your changes that you make to a file. It also allows the person to explain why they made the change and where they made it. This is extremely useful for a group of developers working on the same files. Without the ability to record changes things would get confusin really quickly. This is important becasue it is important to stay organized when working on your files. Along with proper comments, documenting your changes can not only help a group of developers, but help a solo person recognize their changes over time. </p>
